## Modelling 

### EBM 
* [qBioTurin/epimod](https://github.com/qBioTurin/epimod): Modeling framework for the analysis of epidemiological systems, which exploits Petri Net graphical formalism, R environment, and Docker containerization to derive a tool easily accessible by any researcher even without advanced mathematical and computational skills.
* [qBioTurin/COVID-19](https://github.com/qBioTurin/COVID-19):  SEIRS model adopted in Pernice S, Castagno P, Marcotulli L, et al. (2020). [Undetected Cases of Covid-19 and Effects of Social Distancing Strategies: a Modeling Study in Piedmont Region](https://repo.epiprev.it/929). *E&P Repository*
