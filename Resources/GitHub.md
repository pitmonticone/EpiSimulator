## Data

### General 
* [GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid-19-open-data): 
This repository contains datasets of daily time-series data related to COVID-19 for 50+ countries around the world. 

### Symptomatology
* [PAIR-code/covid19_symptom_dataset](https://github.com/PAIR-code/covid19_symptom_dataset)

### Contact 

* [jarvisc1/comix_covid-19-first_wave](https://github.com/jarvisc1/comix_covid-19-first_wave): Code and data from the analysis of the 1st wave of the CoMix 2020 contacts survey

### Mortality 
* [mbevand/covid19-age-stratified-ifr](https://github.com/mbevand/covid19-age-stratified-ifr): This project studies the age-stratified infection fatality ratio (IFR) of COVID-19 comparing COVID-19 to seasonal influenza (flu), calculating the expected overall IFR based on countries' population pyramids and calculating the age-stratified IFR of COVID-19 from the Spanish ENE-COVID serosurvey. 

## Modelling 

### General 
* [Emergent-Epidemics/COVID_crowding](https://github.com/Emergent-Epidemics/COVID_crowding): Code and data for Rader, B., Scarpino, S.V., Nande, A. et al. [Crowding and the shape of COVID-19 epidemics](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1104-0). *Nature Medicine* (2020).

### EBM 
* [qBioTurin/epimod](https://github.com/qBioTurin/epimod): Modeling framework for the analysis of epidemiological systems, which exploits Petri Net graphical formalism, R environment, and Docker containerization to derive a tool easily accessible by any researcher even without advanced mathematical and computational skills.
* [qBioTurin/COVID-19](https://github.com/qBioTurin/COVID-19):  SEIRS model adopted in Pernice S, Castagno P, Marcotulli L, et al. (2020). [Undetected Cases of Covid-19 and Effects of Social Distancing Strategies: a Modeling Study in Piedmont Region](https://repo.epiprev.it/929). *E&P Repository*

### ABM 
* [bwilder0/covid_abm_release](https://github.com/bwilder0/covid_abm_release)
* [ABM-Lab/covid19abm.jl](https://github.com/ABM-Lab/covid19abm.jl)
* [BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/OpenABM-Covid19): OpenABM-Covid19 is an ABM developed to simulate the spread of Covid-19 in a city and to analyse the effect of both passive and active intervention strategies. 

### Surveillance
* [LarremoreLab/covid_surveillance_testing](https://github.com/LarremoreLab/covid_surveillance_testing/blob/master/SEIR_viral_load.py)
