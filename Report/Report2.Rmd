## Data {#data}

We have collected and processed provincial-level geo-spatial data for Italy [@IstatGeo2020] in order to construct the mobility graph, whose nodes represent provinces which are populated according to age-stratified census data [@IstatPop2020] and whose normalized weighted directed edges encode inter-provincial traffic flows [@Pepe2020].

![](/Users/Pit/GitHub/DigitalEpidemiologyProject/Slides/figures/Mobility.png)

The heterogeneous contact patterns among provincial sub-populations are governed by synthetic contact matrices [@Prem2017] whose components $C_{ij}^{L}$ represent the daily contacts that a given agent belonging to age group $i$ has with any agent of age group $j$ in a given location $L \in$ {Home, School, Work, Other}.

![](/Users/Pit/GitHub/DigitalEpidemiologyProject/Slides/figures/Contact.png)

The number of agents in each provincial node and each age group is determined by the actual provincial population adjusted by a scale factor. The internal structure of the agent is completely specified by the following attributes: 

* identifier code $\text{id} \in [1,N] \subset \mathbb{N}$           
* current location $p \in [1,M] \subset \mathbb{N}$
* age group $a \in [1,A] \subset \mathbb{N}$
* residence (origin) location $r \in [1,M] \subset \mathbb{N}$
* workplace location  $\text{wp} \in [1,M] \subset \mathbb{N}$
* household community $\vec{h}, h_j \in \{j \in [1,N] : p_j=p_i\}$
* workplace community $\vec{w}, w_j \in \{j \in [1,N] : \text{wp}_j=\text{wp}_i\}$
* infection state $x \in \{S,E,I_a,I_p,I_s,R,D\}$
* diagnostic state $d \in \{O,N,P,W,R\}$

In order to initialize the workplace locations we let each agent migrate from its residence node according to the probability vector defined by the mobility weights $M_{ij}$. The workplace community is populated by the agents who have been contacted according to $C_{ij}^{\text{Work}}$ sharing the workplace location, while the household community is populated by the agents who have been contacted according to $C_{ij}^{\text{Home}}$.

## Model {#model}

The model consists of two main (extendable) components: the infectious disease transmission module governing the micro, individual-level dynamics and the public health surveillance module driving the macro, system-level dynamics.

### Transmission dynamics {#transmission-module}

The state space of the transmission compartmental module developed to describe the natural history of the disease is defined by the following states: susceptible ($S$), exposed or latent ($E$), asymptomatic infected ($I_a$), pre-symptomatic infected ($I_p$), symptomatic infected ($I_s$), recovered ($R$), died ($D$). All the relevant epidemiological parameters and timing distributions are reported in the [Appendix](#parameters).

<p align="center">
<img src="/Users/Pit/GitHub/DigitalEpidemiologyProject/Images/Epidemiology/EpidemicModelDiagram.png" alt="" width="650"/>
</p>

The scheduled behaviors of the patient is structured as follows:

1. contact household members (if present at home);
2. move to workplace with probability $p_w$ or, with probability $1-p_w$ to another location driven by the mobility weights;
3. contact workplace members;
4. contact a sample of the population in the current nodal location determined by $C_{ij}^{\text{School}}$;
5. contact a sample of the population in the current nodal location determined by $C_{ij}^{\text{Other}}$;
6. move back home with probability $p_h$;

### Surveillance dynamics {#surveillance-module}

The state space of the surveillance compartmental module developed to describe the diagnostic protocol is defined by the following states: untested ($O$), tested negative ($N$), tested positive and not yet negative ($P$), tested negative after being tested positive at least once waiting for second negative test confirming recovery ($W$), tested negative twice consecutively after being positive ($R$). All the relevant diagnostic performance parameters are taken into account and reported in the [Appendix](#parameters). All patients diagnosed as $P$ or $W$ are quarantined at home so that all the contacts in other locations are prevented.  

<p align="center">
<img src="/Users/Pit/GitHub/DigitalEpidemiologyProject/Images/Surveillance/SurveillanceModelDiagram.png" alt="" width="525"/>
</p>

The surveillance module controls all the policy interventions such as inter- and intra-provincial mobility restrictions: we have aggregated the mobility dataset into four distinct phases by integrating information about the timing and stringency of national and sub-national policy interventions [@Hale2020; @DesvarsLarrive2020]. In particular in *phase 3* we modeled the national lockdown enforcement by modulating the contact matrices by an amplification factor [@Prem2020].

## Objectives {#objectives}

1. Model calibration on national and sub-national epidemiological data for Italy
1. Scenario analysis to explore the impact of exogenous/policy-driven and endogenous/behavior-driven social distancing
1. Sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the model to changes in timing distributions, behavioral and mobility patterns, household and workplace structures,  geo-spatial and temporal resolutions, digital contact-tracing coverage
1. Multi-objective assessment (e.g. public health vs. epistemic, clinical vs. epidemiological value) of the [portfolio of diagnostic strategies](#diagnostic-strategies) implemented by the surveillance module

## Current limitations {#limitations}

* All typical limitations of agent-based and metapopulation models are inherited [@Ajelli2010]
* Geospatial and temporal resolutions
* Conservation of global population size
* Large uncertainty in the initial condition (date, location and number of infected patients)
* Lack of realistic regional-level heterogeneity in [diagnostic protocols](#diagnostic-strategies)
* Absence of hospitalization ($H$, $ICU$) compartments in [transmission module](#transmission-module)
* Absence of behavioral module 
* Absence of diagnostic performance of medical doctors (in absence of laboratory resources)

## Future developments {#future-developments}

1. Implementation of hospitalization ($H$, $ICU$) compartments in [transmission module](#transmission-module)
1. Implementation of global and local, prevalence-based and opinion-based behavioral module 
1. Violation of conservation of global population size with airport mobility 
1. Fine-graining of household and workplace structures
1. Model calibration on a given region with municipal-level mobility and epidemiological data
